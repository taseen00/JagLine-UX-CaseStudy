# 🧪 JagLine UX Case Study

This project evaluates the usability of the JagLine Shuttle App at IUPUI using UX research methods such as Novice-Expert Ratio (NER), task success rate analysis, and performance matrix evaluations.

## 📈 Features

- Calculates NER to identify areas where novice users struggle
- Evaluates success/failure rate of each app task
- Generates visualizations and tailored design recommendations
- Colab-ready Python script for analysis
- CSV export of redesign priorities

## 🔍 Key Insights

- NER > 10 observed in several tasks — strong indication of poor learnability
- Subtasks with < 40% success rate marked for major redesign
- Actionable design suggestions are categorized into Major, Moderate, Minor fixes

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload `JagLine_UX_Complete_Cleaned_Colab.py` and `IDM Data.xlsx` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run the notebook step-by-step
3. View charts and download CSV of design recommendations
